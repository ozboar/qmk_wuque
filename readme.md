## Installation Instructions

1. [Build from source](keyboards/meletrix/zoom65_v3) or download the jailbroken firmware from [the releases page](https://github.com/ozwaldorf/qmk_firmware/releases/latest) for your pcb revision (ANSI-only or ISO-ANSI)
2. Hold down ESC and plug keyboard in to enter DFU boot mode
3. Flash jailbroken firmware with qmk cli (Linux, Windows, Mac) or qmk toolbox (Windows, Mac)

5. Connect and customize device in via

## Uninstallation

Stock firmware can be restored at any point by holding the esc key while plugging in the device and flashing the stock firmware. In the absolute worst case of a bricked keyboard, hold pin 64 to pin 60 while plugging in the device.
